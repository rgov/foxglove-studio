// Workaround for code using measureText during initial render. Even if the font data is available
// immediately (because we use a data: url), Chrome doesn't parse/load it until it's "used" on the
// page, which we can trigger by adding a dummy element with some text.
//
// Without waiting, initial measureText calls have the wrong result, and the font sometimes doesn't
// appear in screenshot tests.
